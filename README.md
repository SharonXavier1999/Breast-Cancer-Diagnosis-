📖 Research Paper:

This repository is complemented by a detailed IEEE-format research paper, discussing methodology, comparative analysis, and results.

🎯 Why This Project Stands Out?

✅ Integrates feature importance analysis to enhance interpretability

✅ Deploys a real-time interactive tool rather than just a static model

✅ Implements structured preprocessing & performance validation for reliability

✅ Benchmarks different ML models to justify logistic regression’s efficiency

💡 Future Work: 

Extend to deep learning (CNNs), integrate real-world clinical datasets, and deploy as a cloud-based diagnostic tool.
